# Link-prediction-in-social-networks

This repository deals with link/edge prediction in social networks. A network is represented as an undirected graph. The aim is to infer which new interactions among its members
are likely to occur in the near future. The following are some approaches to link prediction based on measures for analyzing the “proximity” of nodes in a network.

1. Jaccard’s coefficient
2. Katz’s score
3. Hitting time

C programming language was used. Both adjacency list (especially) and adjacency matrix representation of the undirected graph were used. Adjacency lists were represented by both linked lists and array and their code is present in different files. Dynamic programming was used in the third part so as to improve time complexity.
